* What issues can I inform?
This section is for informing a bug. If you want to propose features, ideas, etc., please open a discussion at https://github.com/zircleUI/zircleUI/discussions 

You can also open an issue if the documentation is not clear enough.

* How to inform?
Just try to explain what happens and what is expected to happen. Also, it would very useful to provide a way to reproduce the issue (JSFiddle, CodePen, CodeSandbox or provide a GitHub repo).
